# _BFS algorithm simulation_

## A C# personal project

Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbours. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)

I created a program that Observed in a lesson in algorithms at the beginning of the course, running **BFS (Breadth-first search) algorithm** . and a week after learning the algorithm, it was very interesting to see it running step by step like a debugger. BFS is an algorithm for finding the shortest path from the top of the source s to any other vertex in a given G graph. The software shows the algorithm running on the left, and the graph on the right side of the top, and the bottom of the algorithm's output on the shortest paths. The project was very challenging visually. And a very impressive result.

## The Instructions: 

On the top right under the logo, there is a Options button.

* After clicking on it (There is a folder named in the project where the .exe file is convenient to run without running Visual Studio)
* a menu opens to the right, where you enter the total number of vertices of the graph, and then the matrix of the neighbors. In other words, each line has a vertex, from which a connection is made to the top of the column in which it is marked
* You can of course choose in advance whether the graph is deliberate or unintentional. The algorithm primarily works as planned for a deliberate graph, but of course can also 
* Then, click on the Data Initialization row. And the graph will be created
* On the left side of the algorithm there will be a button to run it, you can manually run a row line, or run it automatically at the speed you choose ..
* The output of the algorithm (table) will appear below the graph
* And finally it will be possible to see the resulting distance tree.
work on an unintended graph...
